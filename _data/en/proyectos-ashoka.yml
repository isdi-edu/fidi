    'Ashoka is an international network of social entrepreneurs. Currently, there are many people out there like you and me who have a story to tell and deserve to be heard. Will you help us give them a voice?<br />
    <br />
    We want to launch a new website and blog called <strong>“Stories of Change”</strong>, to tell the stories and experiences of young people, schools, social entrepreneurs, businesses and all other actors. But to do that we need your expertise.<br />
    <br />
    Will you help us develop a strategic contents plan, the web architecture, the social media plan and Google Grants?<br />
    <br />
    With 30 hours of your work, all these experiences can be shared and we will make a true change of reality.'
