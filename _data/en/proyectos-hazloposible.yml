    'Hazloposible.org is an innovative foundation that shares the vision of achieving a more participatory society that is actively involved in building a better world.<br />
    <br />
    They work to ensure all NGOs have the necessary resources to make their projects a reality. They do this by channelling talent, and through their crowdfunding platform.<br />
    <br />
    They currently have 7 digital projects that pose a challenge in defining a brand strategy. To do this, they need to identify the purpose of each project, its performance indicators and above all to apply the web analytics strategy to improve the user experience of our platforms and websites.<br />
    <br />
    This is a major challenge, a process to move the focus towards customer behaviour, data, communication, the conversion funnel, tools, segmentation and internal process management.<br />
    <br />
    Will you help us design the strategic plan and build a more altruistic world?'
