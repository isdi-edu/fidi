    CONSTRUCTION OF AN ONLINE PLATFORM FOR BOOSTING THE BOND OF SOLIDARITY BETWEEN SPAIN AND LATIN AMERICA
  localizacion:
    Madrid
  necesidad:
    'The boys and girls sponsored by the partners of Ayuda en Acción are always looking to be in constant contact with their sponsors. At the same time, the sponsors want to know about the realities of their communities...<br />
    <br /> 
    For this reason, the objective of Ayuda en Acción is to, by means of sponsorship, establish a <strong>bond of solidarity</strong> with the community in which the child lives, so that they can share their respective realities.<br />
    <br />
    Fortunately, in the digital world, we have a solution for advancing in the effective and bidirectional construction of the bond of solidarity. So Ayuda en Acción needs to <strong>build a platform</strong> that offers its Spanish Partners an easy and intuitive way of sharing with the children and the communities, things like photographs, messages, videos, images, news, etc. <br />
    <br />
    Can you carry out a functional analysis and help us design that platform to make this project a reality? <br />
    <br />
    With just 40 hours of your help, we hope to increase the ability of the partners and the people in these communities to have a platform of exchange.'

    PROPOSAL FOR THE USE OF GEO-LOCATION AS AN INSTRUMENT OF MANAGEMENT AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE BASIC PROJECTS AND PROCESSES OF AYUDA EN ACCIÓN FOR DIGITAL VOLUNTEERING
  necesidad:
    'In a global world, poverty has become global. There are not just also poor countries but poor people in all countries.<br />
    <br />
    Ayuda en Acción frequently fights rural poverty in <strong>isolated communities</strong>.<br />
    <br />
    For them, it is a challenge to make these communities visible, see where they are and what their realities are. Furthermore, sharing information on what they do and where they do it is the best tool for joining efforts and improving their work.<br />
    <br />
    Ayuda en Acción needs 40 hours of dedication to the preparation of a proposal of ways to <strong>use geo-location</strong> to improve its processes and projects, as well as transparency in the information it shares with third parties.<br />
    <br />
    Do you want to take the first step in the design and functional analysis of the proposal?<br />
    <br />
    You will help us to access the communities that, without you, Ayuda en Acción could not work with.'
